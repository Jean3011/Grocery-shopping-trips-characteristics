## Understanding characteristics of grocery shopping trips in the Netherlands

One of the most significant reasons for a trip is to do grocery shopping. In fact, according 
to the Dutch National Travel Survey (NTS), there are more trips made for shopping than 
for work and almost three-quarters of these shopping excursions are for groceries
(Veenstra, Thomas, & Tutert, 2010). But little is known about this type of trips in the 
Netherlands, therefore, this thesis is about the characteristics of grocery shopping trips. 
The main goal of this research assignment is to properly analyse the data acquired from 
a dataset provided by Mobidot using statistical approaches in order to gain a better 
understanding of grocery shopping trips. In order to accomplish so, the variables affecting 
the frequency of grocery shopping and modes of transportation chosen for this activity 
were examined. 

A negative binomial regression model was performed to evaluate the relation between 
the frequency of trips and the independent variables. The goal is to identify with certainty 
which socio-demographic and spatial factors are most important, which may be ignored, 
and how these factors interact to predict the frequency of grocery shopping trips. Besides 
that, a multinomial logit model allowed determining the probability that an individual 
chooses an alternative mode of transportation based on the independent variables. 

Among the primary findings was that the distance to the supermarket has a substantial 
impact not only on the number of trips to the supermarket but also on the mode choice. 
For example, when the distance is less than 2 kilometers, the frequency of trips increases,
and greener modes of transportation are chosen. Furthermore, as the time spent on the 
supermarket increases, less trips are done per month and car became the most probable 
mode of transportation. From the socio-demographic characteristics, it was found that 
annual income has an inverse relation with the frequency of trips and that individuals that 
have a lower income are more likely to use their bikes or to walk for this activity. 

Finally, it is suggested to have a more in-depth analysis for this type of trips because many 
more variables that were not consider in this study may have a significant effect on the 
two main topics studied here. For instance, the growth of e-bikes could have a great 
positive impact on the transportation mode choice since they are more cost-effective for 
this short trips. Additionally, as the Netherlands focuses on promoting cycling, it could be 
that in a near future, the predominant transportation mode for short-distance related 
activities changes from car to bike. Another factor that could affect this type of trips is the 
increasing delivery services offered by the supermarkets in the Netherlands. Therefore, 
more attention must be paid to this topic.

## Note
Unfortunately, the data used for this research was provided by a private company, therefore I cannot share the dataset.
